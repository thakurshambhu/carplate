      <p class="sub-heading">We understand that everyone wants the best deal possible together with top quality service. Before we advertise and list any number plate for sale, we check the prices of similar numbers advertised with our competitors.</p>

      <h2>Vanity.Club are the price beaters!</h2>
      <p>Carreg offer value for money and the very best possible service! Our aim is to provide the very best value for money within our industry. We will endeavour to match if not beat our competitors prices.</p>

      <h2>Online Discounts</h2>
      <p>Save $10–$50 when you purchase a number plate online rather than over the phone. Buying private number plates with us is so easy, 100% safe and secure. Our secure online shop is open 24/7!</p>

      <h2>Price Guide</h2>
      <p>Unissued prefix and current style registrations start from an incredible $179 (+VAT) + $80 DVLA transfer fee. Previously owned cherished number plates are more expensive because the registrations are more sought after. However our stock starts from only $300. We do have some cheap suffix plates and Northern Irish origin number plates for as little as $99.</p>
      <p>Number plates with the letters displayed as A5 ABC would be described as a “Prefix registration” or “Prefix number plates”. These registrations would normally be sold from $179 unless of course the letters spell a name or a word. A5 TON was withheld for a DVLA Auction and later sold for a hammer price $61,000. K1 NGS sold for $185,000. BUT, K11 NGS sold as a normal issue for $250. Whilst “New style plates” like JW18 JDW can be purchased for as little as $399.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Vanity.Club offer a full money back guarantee in the unlikely event of us not being able to supply your chosen registration mark due to problems beyond our control.<br></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>After you have chosen to buy your registration online you will be taken to a checkout screen which will show the price of the registration plus any VAT due, and the DVLA transfer fee – see below. At this stage you have not committed to buy so you can review the <strong>full price breakdown</strong> before entering any personal or payment information.</p>

      <p>If you are happy to proceed you can choose to <strong>add physical number plates</strong> from $20 and also ask us to complete the registration <strong>transfer paperwork</strong> for you for $25. However these additional services are entirely optional. You then choose how you would like to pay and may be offered the option of finance.

      <h2>VAT and DVLA Transfer Fees</h2>
      <p>Some registrations may be subject to VAT, all car registrations are subject to the DVLA transfer fee of $80. The transfer fee is levied by the DVLA and has to be paid on all purchases from any supplier <strong>including</strong> the DVLA themselves.</p>
